# I-dream-of-creating-my-own-security-device-on-a-car-and-modernizing-it-myself
I teach autoelectrics and I repair the electronics of the car, but with pragramming only started. I really liked the projects on arduino and I was very excited to create my alarm system.     Firstly, I need to create a security system to be managed from the phone via bluetooth and the GPRS system. preferably on the CAN and LIN digital buses. advise where to begin. thank you in advance
